# Beeftext

Beeftext is a text snippet management tool for Windows, inspired by [TextExpander].

TextExpander is a great program, packed with features. To to keep the company profitable, 
[Smile] had to switch to a subscription-based model in 2016. And for people who only need the
basic features of TextExpander, the monthly price is way too high.

BeefText aims to be the best possible alternative to TextExpander. Beeftext is an open-source project 
written in C++ using the [Qt] framework.
